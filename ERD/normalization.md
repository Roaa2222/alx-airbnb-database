## ðŸ§± Step 1: First Normal Form (1NF)

**Rule:**  
- Each table must have a primary key.
- No repeating groups or arrays.
- Atomic (indivisible) values only.

âœ… Our schema satisfies 1NF:
- All tables (User, Property, Booking, Payment, Review, Message) have a primary key.
- All fields are atomic (e.g., `first_name`, `email`, `role`, etc.).
- No multi-valued attributes exist.

## ðŸ§± Step 2: Second Normal Form (2NF)

**Rule:**  
- Satisfy 1NF.
- All non-key attributes must depend on the **whole** primary key (not just part of it).

âœ… Our schema satisfies 2NF:
- Tables with composite keys are avoided; all use single-column UUID primary keys.
- In `Booking`, `total_price`, `start_date`, and `end_date` depend entirely on `booking_id`.
- In `Property`, attributes like `location`, `description`, and `price_per_night` depend fully on `property_id`.

---

## ðŸ§± Step 3: Third Normal Form (3NF)

**Rule:**  
- Satisfy 2NF.
- No transitive dependencies (non-key attributes must not depend on other non-key attributes).

âœ… Our schema satisfies 3NF:
- In `User`, `role` is independent of other non-key fields.
- In `Property`, `location` and `price_per_night` are not derived from `host_id`.
- In `Payment`, `payment_method` and `amount` are not derived from any other non-key field.
- In `Message`, `message_body` only depends on `message_id`.
